Guidoc
======


Guidoc is a python package that allows you to create Tkinter widget layouts using a simple docstring specification.


Requirements
------------

Guidoc requires either Python 2.7 or Python 3.x and no additional libraries.
It is recommended that you install the docutils package needed to parse
tabular grid layouts.

The installation script depends on setuptools which will be installed if it
isn't currently present in your Python distribution. The source is written in
Python 2.7 syntax but will convert cleanly to Python 3 when the installer
passes it through 2to3.


Download
--------

You can access the Guidoc Git repository from `Github
<https://github.com/kevinpt/guidoc>`_. You can install direct from PyPI with the "pip"
command if you have it available.


Documentation
